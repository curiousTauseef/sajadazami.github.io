            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I was born in 1995 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz">Tabriz</a>, a historical city located in
            North-Western part of Iran. I was
            raised as a
            bilingual child since
            the province I was born in is Turkish and official language of the country is Farsi. In 2006 I was accepted
            into the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents">NODET</a>
            (National Organization for Developing Exceptional Talents) school. I spent seven years there
            until I was admitted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amirkabir_University_of_Technology">Amirkabir
                University of Technology</a> in Tehran at 2013. Living away from family in
            a dorm room in the 10 Million populated city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran">Tehran</a>
            was a great experience, teaching me so many things
            about life.<br><br>

            I spent the first three semesters of my B.S., learning programming languages and software engineering
            concepts. I started with C and C++ and then I learned Java and Android programming and developed some
            applications in an experienced team. Later, I learned Python and some related packages.<br><br>

            I became familiar with AI world in Robotics Lab of the department supervised by <a
                    href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eezKfB4AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Shiry</a>, working on
            Multi-Agent Exploration and Human Detection System of robots in a 3D simulated environment(Gazebo).<br><br>

            From the beginning of my third year(5th semester), I started to learn about Machine Learning by watching
            online courses and reading books. Later I audited Machine Learning graduate course and took Statistical
            Machine Learning graduate course instructed by <a href="http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~nikabadi/">Dr. Nickabadi</a>
            to gain a deeper understanding of ML concepts.
            We worked on various projects related to these fields and participated in some data mining competitions in
            <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> and <a href="http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/">DMC</a>.<br><br>

            By the fourth year, we moved to Cognitive Robotics Lab of the department and I started working on Computer
            Vision problems using Deep Learning methods which led to a publication on 2017. Later that summer, we collaborated with
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qsOtJtsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Amigoni</a> in
            <a href="http://airlab.deib.polimi.it/">AIRLab</a> of
            Politecnico di Milano, Italy on a project related to simulation of robot
            communication and its impact on tasks like SLAM or exploration.<br><br>

            Since I used to read Philosophy and Psychology books/novels, I found Cognitive Science very exciting, so I
            tried to get into the field by watching videos lectures and reading more. Recently, I'm expanding my
            knowledge in Computational Neuroscience by reading books and papers and participating in
            <a href="http://www.ipm.ac.ir/personalinfo.jsp?PeopleCode=IP1400068">Prof. Abdolhossein Abbasian</a>'s
            weekly long discussions in <a href="http://scs.ipm.ac.ir/">School of Cognitive Science(SCS)</a> of The
            Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences(IPM).<br><br>

            Currently, I'm working on two projects, Object-Aware Person Recognition of PIPA Dataset(Computer Vision), and Corresponding
            ECoG, fMRI and EEG Signals in Human VTC in Royan Institue of Research collaborating with
            <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=3HbeiywAAAAJ">Prof. Khaligh-Razavi</a> from
            MIT(Neuroscience, Deep Learning).<br><br>
